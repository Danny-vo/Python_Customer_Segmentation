Indidivual Project

Objective: Identify distinct customer segments based on a dataset of 2,000 customers with their information on bookings and their interactions with the travel agency (7 variables). Based on common characteristic, customers can be divided into different groups and companies can market them effectively. 

Method: Choose the optimal number of customer segments using the Elbow Method. Estimate the clusters using both the K-means++ and Agglomerative Clustering techniques

Results: 2 clusters were found with distinct characteristics for each group. Number of overlaps in each Cluster identified by both method are high. Recommendation of marketing strategies for each cluster is given in the report.
